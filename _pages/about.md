I am a senior at Berkeley, majoring in physics and computer science. My research interests primarily focus on the intersection of machine learning and physical sciences. I am currently an undergraduate researcher at Prof. Aditi Krishnapriyan's group at Berkeley Artificial Intellegence Research (BAIR), studying machine learning for molecular dynamics with an emphasis on equivariance and computational efficiency. Before that, I interned at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) through the Caltech SURF program, jointly supervised by Prof. Maria Spiropulu (Caltech), Dr. Jennifer Ngadiuba (Fermilab), and Dr. Jean-Roch Vlimant (CERN). I worked on knowledge distillation and anomaly detection for new physics search at the CMS experiment. Before that, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) supervised by Dr. Paolo Calafiura and Dr. Daniel Murnane. I worked on graph neural network tracking for the ATLAS ITk upgrade and advanced training techniques for self-supervised pretraining.

In my free time, I enjoy anime, piano, and boardgames.
